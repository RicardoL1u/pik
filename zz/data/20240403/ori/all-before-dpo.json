The purple book is to the right of the white book.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that the order from left to right must be either purple book, blue book, or white book, blue book, purple book. However, statement 2 tells us that the purple book is not the leftmost, as it is to the right of the white book.\n\nTherefore, the order must be white book, purple book, blue book.

It might be a way to emphasize that vaccines are the result of scientific research, which some people might refute or criticize.\n\n(B) \"EVOLUTION CAUSES VACCINES!\" - This statement is less obviously sarcastic, as it doesn't directly relate the concept of evolution to the development of vaccines. Evolution is a biological process, while vaccines are a result of medical research. However, it could still be interpreted as sarcasm if the speaker is suggesting that vaccines are a product of natural progression, which is not the case; they are developed through human intervention.\n\nGiven the context, (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it directly connects the scientific method to vaccines in a way that could be seen as mocking anti-science beliefs.

Take 6 steps right.\n\nLet's convert these steps into a 2D plane, where left is -X and right is +X, and we start facing forward, which is the positive Y-axis.\n\nAfter the first two steps:\n- You've turned 9 + 5 = 14 steps to the left, which is a 14/90 = 7/45 turn counter-clockwise around the starting point (assuming each step is the same unit distance).\n\nAfter the next two steps:\n- You've turned 8 steps to the right, then 6 steps to the right, which is a total of 8 + 6 = 14 steps to the right, or a 14/90 = 7/45 turn clockwise around the starting point.\n\nSince the left turns and right turns cancel each other out (7/45 counter-clockwise + 7/45 clockwise = 0), you end up facing the same direction as you started. However, we also need to consider if you've moved along the Y-axis (forward or backward).\n\nSince all the instructions were about moving left and right, there were no instructions to move forward or backward. Therefore, after executing all the instructions, you would be at the same spot you started, facing the same direction.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n- Yes"

The blue jay is to the left of the falcon.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the owl is not the leftmost, and there is an object to its left.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the quail is to the left of the owl, so the quail must be either the leftmost or second from the left.\n\nFrom statement 3, the crow is to the right of the falcon, so the falcon cannot be the rightmost.\n\nFrom statements 4 and 5, we can create a sequence for the hummingbird, raven, and blue jay, but not their exact positions relative to the owl, quail, and falcon.\n\nFrom statement 6, the blue jay is to the left of the falcon, which means the falcon cannot be the leftmost, and the blue jay is not the rightmost.\n\nCombining these, we can deduce the following:\n- The owl is second from the left.\n- The quail is either the leftmost or second from the left.\n- The falcon is not the leftmost or the rightmost.\n- The blue jay is to the left of the falcon and not the rightmost.\n- The crow is to the right of the falcon.\n- The sequence for the raven, hummingbird, and blue jay is not fully determined, but the raven is to the left of the hummingbird, which is to the left of the blue jay.\n\nGiven this information, the only statement that is definitely true is that the quail is the leftmost, as it is the only one explicitly stated to be to the left of the owl, who is second from the left.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The quail is the leftmost."

However, this inference is not necessarily true based on the given premises. The premises only establish relationships between not being a sister of Pricilla and not being a granddaughter of Hellen, and between being a sister of Wanda and being a granddaughter of Hellen. They do not provide any direct information about the relationship between being a sister of Pricilla and being a sister of Wanda.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not deductively valid.

Therefore, ¬B(N) → B(A)\n\nHere, B(X) represents being a loyal buyer of product X, and U(Y) represents being an infrequent user of product Y.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that no one can be both a loyal buyer of Nioxin (¬B(N)) and an infrequent user of Kirk's soap (¬U(K)).\n\nFrom premise 2, we have that not being a loyal buyer of Aveeno (¬B(A)) implies being an infrequent user of both Head & Shoulders (U(H)) and Kirk's soap (U(K)).\n\nFrom premise 3, we learn that being an infrequent user of Head & Shoulders (U(H)) necessitates not being a loyal buyer of Nioxin (¬B(N)).\n\nThe conclusion, ¬B(N) → B(A), states that if someone is not a loyal buyer of Nioxin, then they are a loyal buyer of Aveeno.\n\nTo determine deductive validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Let's consider the possibility of ¬B(N) being true. According to premise 3, if ¬B(N), then U(H). But premise 2 tells us that U(H) implies U(K) and ¬B(A). However, premise 1 already rules out the possibility of ¬B(N) and U(K) together. Therefore, if ¬B(N), it cannot be the case that U(K), which means premise 2's implication cannot be fully realized, as U(K) is prevented by premise 1.\n\nThis creates a contradiction, as the premises cannot all be true simultaneously if ¬B(N).

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a yellow book, a black book, a green book, a red book, a purple book, a white book, and a blue book. The green book is to the left of the yellow book. The red book is the rightmost. The green book is to the right of the blue book. The white book is to the left of the blue book.

The white book is to the left of the blue book.\n5. The yellow book is the fourth from the left.\n6. The black book is the second from the right.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that the yellow book is in the middle of the shelf. Since the red book is the rightmost, and the yellow book is fourth from the left, the order from left to right must be: white, blue, green, yellow, _, black, red.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the green book is to the left of the yellow book, so the order becomes: white, blue, green, yellow, _, black, red.\n\nFrom statement 3, the green book is to the right of the blue book, so the order is: white, blue, green, yellow, _, black, red.\n\nFrom statement 4, the white book is to the left of the blue book, so the final order is: white, blue, green, yellow, purple, black, red.\n\nNow, we can deduce the positions of the books:\n- The yellow book is fourth from the left.\n- The black book is second from the right.\n- The green book is third from the left.\n- The red book is the rightmost.\n- The white book is to the left of blue, so it's first from the left.\n- The blue book is second from the left.\n- The purple book is fifth from the left.\n\nNone of the options match the leftmost book, which is the white book. However, the options given do not include the correct answer (white book). This seems to be an error in the options provided. The correct answer should be (F) The white book is the leftmost."

This implies that everyone is either a frequent consumer of at least one of these or both.\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot directly infer that being a frequent consumer of Neutrogena shampoo is necessary for being a rare consumer of Pacifica soap. It is possible that someone is a rare consumer of Pacifica soap without being a frequent consumer of Neutrogena shampoo, as long as they are frequent consumers of The Body Shop soap (which would satisfy the second premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not deductively valid.\n\nA: invalid"

This also means that the pears cannot be the cheapest (G is false).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(E) The kiwis are the cheapest."

The blue jay is to the left of the falcon.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the owl is in the second position, so (B) is correct.\n\nFrom statement 2, since the quail is to the left of the owl, the quail must be in the first position.

But we don't know their exact positions relative to the owl and falcon.\n\nFrom statement 6, the blue jay is to the left of the falcon, which means the falcon cannot be the second from the left, as the blue jay must be between them.

In ice hockey, players skate and do not \"walk,\" and the game involves a puck, not a ball.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Roman Josi walked on ball four\" is not plausible, as it combines elements from two different sports (ice hockey and baseball) in a way that doesn't make sense."

This is equivalent to saying that if someone is a nephew of Adolph, they are not a half-brother of Desmond.\n\nHowever, these premises do not logically entail that every schoolmate of Freddy who is a workmate of David is also a nephew of Adolph. It is possible that there are individuals who are schoolmates of Freddy and workmates of David but are neither half-brothers nor nephews of Adolph. The premises only rule out certain relationships but do not establish a positive relationship between being a schoolmate and workmate of specific people and being a nephew of Adolph.\n\nTherefore, the argument is deductively **invalid**."

The only position left for the hummingbird is 5, and the blue jay must be in position 3, with the crow in position 5.\n\nNow we have the order: quail (1) - owl (2) - blue jay (3) - falcon (4) - hummingbird (5) - raven (6) - crow (7).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that:\n- The quail is not the rightmost, so (C) is false.\n- The owl is not the rightmost, so (B) is false.\n- The raven is not the rightmost, so (D) is false.\n- The hummingbird is not the rightmost, so (E) is false.\n- The blue jay is not the rightmost, so (F) is false.\n- The crow is the rightmost, so (G) is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (G) The crow is the rightmost."

Since the loquats are the second-cheapest, the other fruit must be the kiwis. Therefore, the kiwis are the cheapest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the pears are more expensive than the kiwis, so the pears cannot be the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom statement 3, the watermelons are less expensive than the peaches, so they cannot be the second-cheapest either.\n\nFrom statement 5, the watermelons are the third-most expensive, which means they cannot be the second-cheapest.\n\nFrom statement 6, the plums are the second-most expensive, which directly contradicts (B), (C), and (F) as they all suggest the second-cheapest position.

It is really difficult to keep track of all chemicals one is regularly exposed to. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: Being an ingredient of Anti-Redness Powder is sufficient for not being an ingredient of LEGENDARY BROWS. Therefore, being an ingredient of Anti-Redness Powder is necessary for not being an ingredient of LEGENDARY BROWS.\"\n Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?- valid\n- invalid\nA: Let's think step by step.",
        "output": "The argument presented can be represented in symbolic form as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If X is an ingredient of Anti-Redness Powder, then X is not an ingredient of LEGENDARY BROWS.\nSymbolically: If X ∈ Anti-Redness_Powder, then X ∉ LEGENDARY_BROWS.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, being an ingredient of Anti-Redness Powder is necessary for not being an ingredient of LEGENDARY BROWS.\nSymbolically: X ∈ Anti-Redness_Powder → X ∉ LEGENDARY_BROWS → X ∈ Anti-Redness_Powder is necessary for X ∉ LEGENDARY_BROWS.\n\nThe argument is attempting to infer a necessary condition from a sufficient one. While the premise states that being in Anti-Redness Powder is sufficient to not be in LEGENDARY BROWS, it does not logically follow that it is also necessary. There could be other ingredients that are not in both products.\n\nFor an argument to be deductively valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is not entailed by the premise; it is a stronger claim than the premise supports. Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid.\n\nA: invalid"
